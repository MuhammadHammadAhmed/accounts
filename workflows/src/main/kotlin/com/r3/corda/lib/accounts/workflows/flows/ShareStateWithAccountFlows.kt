/**
 * This flow shares a [StateAndRef] with an account as opposed to a full node. The difference is subtle and worth
 * explaining here. When an account receives a [StateAndRef], it is stored in the vault of the host node using
 * [StatesToRecord.ALL_VISIBLE], this means that the node administrator can see all [StateAndRef]s which have been sent
 * to accounts which they host. As well as storing the state in the vault, the host node also permissions the
 * [StateAndRef] such that only the owner of the specified account can see it. Any other accounts on the same node
 * will not be able to see the state. This permissioning is done at the application level through vault queries, see
 * [accountQueryCriteria] for further information. This does mean that if account holders have access to the node via
 * RPC directly, then they can "override" the account level query and potentially see states permissioned to other
 * accounts. The remedy for this is to ensure that account holders only access their accounts via an application which
 * correctly handles state level permissioning.
 *
 * Permissioning for "observed" states is required, where as for "held" states it is not because when an account holder
 * holds a state, the public key used to hold that state links back to the account id - the node holds a mapping of
 * account IDs to public keys which can be used when querying the vault by account ID. However, in the case of "observed"
 * states which are not held by an account but can be seen by an account, there is no participant public key inside the
 * state attributable to the account holder, therefore we must store a separate table of information pertaining to the
 * set of states which can account is allowed to see. See the [AllowedToSeeStateMapping] for further details.
 *
 * @property accountInfo the account to share the [StateAndRef] with
 * @property state the [StateAndRef] to share
 * @property hostSession an existing [FlowSession] with the host node
